# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

Ejects the app from Create React App's build setup.\
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.\
All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.\
At this point you're on your own.

### `npm run optimize-images`

Runs a Node script to optimize images.

### `npm run deploy:gh-pages`

Builds the app for production and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

### `npm run version:patch`

Increments the patch version number, pushes the changes to the remote repository, and creates a new tag.

### `npm run version:minor`

Increments the minor version number, pushes the changes to the remote repository, and creates a new tag.

### `npm run version:major`

Increments the major version number, pushes the changes to the remote repository, and creates a new tag.

### `npm run start:prd`

Runs the app in production mode using the `serve` package.

### `npm run optimize:build`

Runs the `npm run optimize-images` command and then builds the app for production.
